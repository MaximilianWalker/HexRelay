# Contracts Index

## Document Metadata

- Doc ID: contracts-index
- Owner: API and realtime maintainers
- Status: ready
- Scope: repository
- last_updated: 2026-03-04
- Source of truth: `docs/contracts/README.md`

## Quick Context

- Primary routing index for contract authority and runtime-vs-target-state separation.
- Update this file when contract authority or contract artifact scope changes.
- Latest meaningful change: 2026-03-04 promoted runtime REST authority to `runtime-rest-v1` and kept legacy iteration contract path as compatibility alias.

## Purpose

- Separate **current runtime contracts** from **target-state model contracts** to avoid implementation drift confusion.

## Current Runtime Contracts

- REST runtime baseline: `docs/contracts/runtime-rest-v1.openapi.yaml`
- REST compatibility alias (legacy path): `docs/contracts/iteration-01-identity-auth-invites.openapi.yaml`
- Realtime runtime baseline: `docs/contracts/realtime-events-runtime-v1.asyncapi.yaml`
- Crypto profile baseline: `docs/contracts/crypto-profile-v1.md`

## Target-State Model Contracts

- Future REST coverage model: `docs/contracts/mvp-rest-v1.openapi.yaml`
- Future realtime event model: `docs/contracts/realtime-events-v1.asyncapi.yaml`

## Usage Rule

- If code must match production/runtime behavior now, use current runtime contracts.
- If planning upcoming epics, use target-state model contracts.
